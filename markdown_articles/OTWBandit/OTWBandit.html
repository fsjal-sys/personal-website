<h2>An Overview <a name="Overview"></a></h2>
<p>OverTheWire is a website which hosts wargames. A wargame is a cyber-security challenge which involves the application of actual cyber-security concepts and tools in order to accomplish some sort of goal. This goal is usually capturing a flag (acquiring a special key hidden within a system). This differs from tests and exams, which are usually knowledge-based. Wargames are far more focused on your applicable skills.</p>
<p>Bandit is OverTheWire’s introductory wargame. With Bandit, there are 33 “levels”. Each “level” is a machine that the user can connect to. Each machine contains a flag, which is a file that contains text. When you start level 0, you connect to the level 0 machine and acquire the flag. Then you connect to the level 1 machine, and you input the flag you found at level 0 as the password to access the machine. With each machine, finding the flag gets more challenging.</p>
<p>By navigating through the different levels of Bandit, players are exposed to a variety of Linux command-line tools and techniques commonly used in cyber-security. Each level presents a unique challenge where the player must use their knowledge of Linux commands and system administration to find hidden flags.</p>
<h2>An Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a></h2>
<p>The Bandit wargame can be accessed on OverTheWire’s website.</p>
<p>The specific webpage can be accessed via this link: <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/</a></p>

<p>The introductory page gives you a basic overview of the wargame. You could give the webpage a quick read, but the information basically boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each level page contains important information on finding the flags.</li>
<li>The left sidebar contains the navigation for each level, you progress from level 0 upwards to level 33.</li>
<li>You’re going to have to use command-line commands.</li>
<li>When you are stuck, you should search online for help, and <strong>try harder</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the part where the webpage introduction says that you’re going to need to use command-line commands. What are command-line interfaces?</p>
<p><img src="./images/windows.png" alt="Image" />

<p>What you’re seeing in the screenshots above are examples of command-line interfaces. The first screenshot shows you the Command Prompt on Windows 10. The user inputted the ‘help’ command, which returns a list of common commands on Windows. The second screenshot shows you a Linux terminal. The user inputted the ‘neofetch’ command, which returned some system information.</p>
<p>You can find these command-line interfaces on any consumer operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux). They are special applications on your system which allow you to communicate with your system by inputting commands. When a typical user communicates with their system, they might click on a button or a graphic of some kind, or they’ll search for an application to help them do something. A command-line interface allows you to just type in a command, and get the system to immediately execute upon that command without having to search for an application or particular button in the system settings.</p>
<p>Command-line interfaces, though less accessible due to the knowledge of commands required, are a lot more efficient and flexible. Command-line interfaces will also often allow for scripting and automation, which means you can get your system to follow a sequence of commands or to automatically execute upon some commands. When it can be properly used, a command-line interface gives the user a lot of control over their system, being a very powerful tool. It is because of this that many important tools, especially those utilized in cyber-security, are developed specifically for command-line interfaces.</p>
<p>Since Bandit requires the use of command-line tools, you need to open up your own command-line interface. These tools can be used on Windows and Mac systems, but the set up would be quite impractical. It’s a lot more impractical to install a virtual machine, and use the virtual machine’s command-line. For this walkthrough, we’re going to be using a Kali Linux virtual machine.</p>
<p>Setting up a virtual machine is pretty simple, here’s a brief setup plan for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link to download to virtual machine software, VirtualBox: <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a></li>
<li>Link to download the specific Kali Linux virtual machine software: <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines">https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines</a></li>
<li>Link to a simple guide on quickly setting the virtual machine up: <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/import-premade-virtualbox/">https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/import-premade-virtualbox/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this, you should have your own Kali Linux virtual machine, which you can use for any wargame, CTF, or other pentesting endeavours.</p>

<h3>Connecting to the Machine with SSH</h3>
<p>In order to connect to the machine, we need to use SSH. SSH (Secure Shell) is a tool that allows a user on one computer to remotely access the command-line interface of another computer.</p>
<p>Locate the terminal on your virtual machine, and type in SSH.</p>
